this generator includes such options:
* gaussian blur
* noise
* brightness
* grayscale
* sepia
* negative
* rotate
* flip (left - right)

user enetring number of images, noise factor 1/2, brightness factor 1/2, sepia depth and rotate degress and then it starts to work with images (e. g. 28):
1. blur on every base image (by the following exapmle now its 56 images)
2. noise 1 on every base image (by the following exapmle now its 84 images)
3. noise 2 on every base image (by the following exapmle now its 112 images)
4. brightness 1 on every base image (by the following exapmle now its 140 images)
5. brightness 2 on every base image (by the following exapmle now its 168 images)
6. grayscale on every base image (by the following exapmle now its 196 images)
7. sepia on every base image (by the following exapmle now its 224 images)
8. negative on every base image (by the following exapmle now its 252 images)
9. rotating every image (not only base!) (by the following exapmle now its 504 images)
10. flipping every image (not only base!) (by the following exapmle now its 1008 images)
